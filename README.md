# CSC301-Simplex-Algorithm
This C++ program implements the Simplex Algorithm for solving Linear Programming problems, allowing users to input constraints and an objective function, then computing and displaying the optimal solution.
This repository provides a C++ implementation of the Simplex algorithm to solve linear programming problems. The user can input constraints and an objective function, and the program applies iterative pivoting to determine the best solution. This implementation is designed for educational purposes, providing a clear and simple approach to solving LP problems.

Key Functionalities
ðŸ”¹ Reads LP problems interactively from user input
ðŸ”¹ Implements tableau-based Simplex method
ðŸ”¹ Outputs optimal variable values and the final objective function value
